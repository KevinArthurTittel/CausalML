# Robust Smooth Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation using Causal Machine Learning

For the MSc Econometrics & Management Science, specializing in Business Analytics & Quantitative Marketing [BAQM], at the Erasmus School of Economics [ESE] in Rotterdam, I have written a theoretical research project titled "Robust Smooth Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation using Causal Machine Learning". In particular, I have implemented several novel causal machine learning methods in order to assess the added value in empirical economics research. Concretely, I have re-examined two relatively recent observational studies by implementing Local Linear Causal Forests [LLCF] of Friedberg et al. (2021) and Generalized Random Forests with Local Centering [GRF] by Athey et al. (2019) on these studies. LLCF is expected to outperform competing methods in case the data has strong smooth underlying signals; since LLCF currently has limited applications in empirical economics, I aim to show that this method can be considered important and effective subject to meaningful and careful choice justifications. To complement the empirical results, I add several simulation results to further demonstrate its added value.
