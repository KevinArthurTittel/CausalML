# Robust Smooth Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation using Causal Machine Learning

For the MSc Econometrics & Management Science, specializing in Business Analytics & Quantitative Marketing [BAQM], at the Erasmus School of Economics [ESE] in Rotterdam, I have written a theoretical research project titled "Robust Smooth Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation using Causal Machine Learning". In particular, I have implemented several novel causal machine learning methods in order to assess the added value in empirical economics research. Concretely, I have re-examined two relatively recent observational studies by implementing Local Linear Causal Forests [LLCF] of Friedberg et al. (2021) and Generalized Random Forests with Local Centering [GRF] by Athey et al. (2019) on these studies. LLCF is expected to outperform competing methods in case the data has strong smooth underlying signals; since LLCF currently has limited applications in empirical economics, I aim to show that this method can be considered important and effective subject to meaningful and careful choice justifications. To complement the empirical results, I add several simulation results to further demonstrate its added value. 

# Replication files

This folder contains replication files for my theoretical MSc thesis titled "Robust Smooth Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation using Causal Machine Learning", as well as a general introduction for the reader. All selected settings for the algorithms here are described in my thesis. Contained in this folder are:

- Extension Table 1 - 4 (Field et al., 2013).R: extend Tables 1 - 4 of the original paper of Field et al. (2013) by applying GRF, Cluster-Robust GRF, and LLCF to examine treatment effects of a grace period on (Table 1) twelve loan use and business formation outcome variables, (Table 2) long-run profit, income and capital variables, (Table 3) default variables, and (Table 4) business size and business behavior variables. This replication file provides tables and plots of ATE estimates (with SE and CI), and heterogeneity evaluations in terms of Best Linear Predictor approach, Rank Average Treatment Effect approach with TOC plots, and Differential ATE approach. 
- Extension Table 5 (Field et al., 2013).R: extends Table 5 of the original paper of Field et al. (2013). GRF, Cluster-Robust GRF, and LLCF are implemented to examine heterogeneity in treatment effects along 5 characteristics (owning a savings account, being risk loving, a chronically ill family member, wage earner, treatment effect modifiers, being impatient) on 3 dependent variables (monthly profits, log of monthly HH income, and capital). This replication file provides tables and plots of ATE and HTE estimates (with SE and CI), heterogeneity evaluations in terms of Best Linear Predictor approach, Rank Average Treatment Effect approach with TOC plots, and Differential ATE approach, variable importance measures with plots of the estimated CATE against variables with highest importance and the above mentioned characteristics of interest.
